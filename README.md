SHRL unlocked game modification files, first brought to my attention by u/Omichron (or whatever) on Reddit. The releases have some information, the original Reddit posts have the rest, but I deleted my account and thought I'd never come back to this. But over the years, I had thoughts about all of this and even some dreams (literally) where I'd get marvelous ideas on how to improve/add cool stuff to SHRL.

I return now, on the 12th of August, 2025, to announce that I'm looking into SHRL, and Superhot modding as a whole.

Here's the roadmap:
1.) I fix up SHRL a bit so it's in a more stable state, by that, I mean:
  a.) Multiple levels seamlessly
  b.) Better enemy AI
  c.) Scripted events in levels (text flashing on screen, moving elements, etc.)
2.) Enhance things outside of SHRL, like:
  a.) Custom piOS file directories
  b.) Launch the game and immediately access code instead of quickly navigating the hierarchy
  c.) And maybe some other stuff I haven't thought of yet.

Basically, everything I wanted to do and am just now thinking of doing. It's a big goal, since I only code for fun and I work differently than other people. No, not autism, you prick, but I don't hold interest in games for long, by that I mean I squeeze the life out of games I play for like a week or 2 then go off and play something else. It's the same here, and also because I ran into a roadblock that stopped me dead in my tracks.

If any of you have been here from the beginning, I'm sure you can recall how I was working on SHRL "Redux". It was supposed to be big, with even help from other coders in on it. But the guy I was trying to work with never responded back one day, I couldn't figure out how to progress, and hated being on Reddit. So it ended abruptly with no announcement I think. I also lost my Github account for a while, no idea why.

Anyway, welcome back, if you've been here before, and sit tight for any future releases. For now, I recommed the v2 release, as I believe that's the most stable currently (no broken code, unimportant additional implements, etc.)
